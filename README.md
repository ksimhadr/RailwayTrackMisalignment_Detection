Railway Track Misalignment Detection with pretrained networks and its performance comparison
# üöÜ Railway Track Misalignment Detection using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to detect **misalignments in railway tracks** from image data. Ensuring track alignment is critical to railway safety, and this model helps automate the inspection process using visual data.

## üß† Project Summary

- **Goal**: Automatically classify railway track images as `aligned` or `misaligned`.
- **Approach**: Fine-tuned deep convolutional networks (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0).
- **Best Performance**: Achieved **98.2% test accuracy** using **VGG16** with transfer learning.
